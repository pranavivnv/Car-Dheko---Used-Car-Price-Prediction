# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Domain:
Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning
Introduction:
In this project, the task is to enhancing the customer experience and optimizing the pricing process for used cars by developing a machine learning model. This model, based on historical car price data, will take into account various features such as the car's make, model, year, fuel type, and transmission type. The goal is to predict the prices of used cars accurately and integrate this model into an interactive web application using Streamlit.
